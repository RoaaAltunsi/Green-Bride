This project is a foundational implementation of an educational game built using Unity. The game features basic game mechanics and interactive elements, focused on environmental education.

**Game Concept:** The main character moves through a simulated environment of Saudi Arabia, progressing through multiple stages. In each stage, the player must plant a specific type of plant native to a particular region of the country, learning about the local flora along the way.
